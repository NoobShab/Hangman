# Hangman
_The game where you try guessing a word and you are guided as per your attempts._

### File inputs:
- [x] **_ProjectFinal.m_**: The repository contains the final coding file. Entire coding inputs is available here.
- [x] **_readDictionary.m_**: Is created as a function to generate random words.<br>This is the core functionality of the game.
- [x] **_hangman.txt_**: The data required for such random generation is stored here.

### How _Hangman_ works?
> The game is based on Command Line Input(CLI).
> 1. You enter the game and you are asked your name.
> 2. Then you are given a random word: to make the game a bit user-friendly the first and last letters are provided.
> 3. The game starts.
> 3. You keep guessing the letter within limited attempts.
>    1. If you guess a letter multiple times, you are provided a warning.
>    2. If you guess a letter wrong, the attempts keep decreasing.
>    3. If you guess a letter right, the attempts remain the same.
#### The main goal: 
Try guessing the word within the attempt limit.
