# Hangman
_The game where you try guessing a word and you are guided as per your attempts._

### File inputs:
- [x] The repository contains the final coding file _ProjectFinal.m_. It includes the entire coding.
- [x] A file named _readDictionary.m_ is created as a function to generate random words.<br>This is the core functionality of the game.
- [x] The data required for such random generation is stored in _hangman.txt_.

### How _Hangman_ works?
> The game is based on Command Line Input(CLI).
> 1. You enter the game and you are asked your name.
> 2. Then you are given a random word: to make the game a bit user-friendly the first and last letters are provided.
> 3. The game starts.
> 3.1 You keep guessing the letter within limited attempts.
>    3.2 If you guess a letter multiple times, you are provided a warning.
>    3.3 If you guess a letter wrong, the attempts keep decreasing.
>    3.4 If you guess a letter right, the attempts remain the same.
#### The main goal: 
Try guessing the word within the attempt limit.
